          p Hey! My name's Tyler Black. It's great to meet you. How are you? I hope well.
          p I moved to Nashville eight years ago, and graduated from Belmont University in 2012 with a degree in music business. I also worked in Business and Consumer sales at Apple for 3 years, and that was a blast. As of late, nearly 6 months to be exact, I have been a software apprentice at the Nashville Software School. Since then, my love for technology and the way it impacts our lives has only grown. I love what I am learning, and am excited to make an impact. I also love creating music, and my dog Biddy. You may or may not find links to both of things somewhere around here :).
